How to Run Connected Cook Locally
Connected Cook has not been deployed as a live application, so it has to be run locally.

After downloading the GitHub repository and adding it to a local directory, run the following terminal commands:

npm i or npm install (Installs project dependencies)
npm run initdb and npm run seed (Creates and seeds the database)
npm run dev (Launches the application)
